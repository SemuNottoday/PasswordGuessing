    <string name="tip1">The main trick in this game is not to find the correct numbers, you will get good at finding the numbers
                            . The game is to find their correct position in the required try or life amount</string>
    <string name="tip2">If your first try was 2468 and your second was 1357, then if the sum of the even and odd is not 4, it means 9 is included in the password</string>
    <string name="tip3">In your first try enter even numbers like 2 4 6 8, and then odd numbers 1 3 5 7 it will help you to cover all the numbers </string>
    <string name="tip4">When you are trying to find the correct ones by changing one or two numbers, dont write the same numbers in same position,
            if the number you tried was 2536, and you want to change 36 by 87, make it like 8725 or 8275.</string>
